RBAC and Authentication Mini-App

---

<p>This assignment shows the <b><i>Confidentiality</i></b> part of the CIA triad, by making different information avaliable to different user roles.</p>
<p>Things like the tax forms, personal address, or paystubs of a person only need to be accessed by that person in question, which is why they are locked behind the role "user."</p>
<p>On the other hand, things like the company's finances or upcomming projects don't need to be accessed by anyone but people with the "admin" role.</p>
